# zig-sga

Low-level implementation of Relic's funky archive format in Zig with comments and clearly named variables.

## Building

Just copy `UI.sga` into the repo directory and `zig run sga.zig` to see some output. This is stupid and dangerous and I pinky promise I'll use `test`s soon!

## Prior Art

Credit where credit's due!

Thanks Janne for the [awesome blog post](https://janne252.dev/content/2021/coh3-pre-alpha-extract-sga) as well as the [SGA viewer tooling](https://github.com/Janne252/essence-archive-viewer) that inspired this effort. A dozen lines of documentation are based off of a table in Janne's blog post. \<3
